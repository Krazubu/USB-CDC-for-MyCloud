# USB CDC-ACM Driver for WD MyCloud devices


These apps are intended for use on various MyCloud devices and contain the driver that allows you to use serial USB devices on those NAS.<br>
This is the USB CDC-ACM Driver from linux kernel 4.14.22, compiled for intel based MyCloud devices under OS 5 version 5.26.119, then packaged as an app.<br>
It was built using toolchain WDMyCloud_PR4100_GPL_v5.26.119_20221229, available on this page : https://support-en.wd.com/app/products/product-detailweb/p/139
Source structure for app packaging was borrowed from https://github.com/hashashin/mycloudapps/tree/master/cdc-acm

It is provided for : PR4100, PR2100, DL4100, DL2100 (tested only with MyCloud PR4100).<br>
It will NOT work with : EX4100, EX2100, EX4, EX2 Ultra, EX2, Mirror Gen2, Mirror, My Cloud 2.xx, My Cloud 04.xx.<br>
It could probably be compiled for ARM too with little effort, but I haven't tried so far as I don't have such hardware.<br>
More infos on various models here https://support-en.wd.com/app/answers/detailweb/a_id/19649/~/my-cloud%3A-differences-between-models<br>
I also provide the kernel module alone, it should work equally for PR4100, PR2100, DL4100 and DL2100. 

## How to use
Download the file corresponding to your device.<br>
Login to the management interface of you device.<br>
Go to Applications tab and click "Install an application manually" (wording may vary)<br>
Load the file you downloaded.<br>
Ensure the app is enabled (it should be by default).<br>

### More infos
The driver will automatically load if the device is rebooted, as long as the app is enabled.<br>
If it was loaded after the device is plugged, it will require replugging the device, or a reboot.<br>
The cdc-acm device(s) will then be available in /dev folder (usually /dev/ttyACM0)<br>
The cdc-acm folder contains the source you can use to update the driver/app yourself. To do so, 1st compile the Linux kernel using WD provided chaintool, then update the newly compiled cdc-acm.ko module in the folder. Finally build the app package, still using the WD provided tool.
